  <p>At Qure.ai, we have always taken a holistic approach towards building solutions for lung health. <em>qXR</em> provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays and is complemented by <em>qTrack</em>, an AI powered disease management platform. In this blog, we unveil our next product <em>qCT-Lung</em> – an AI powered automated analysis of Chest CTs. It can detect findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema and analyse their malignancy. We will add more findings to <em>qCT-Lung</em> in coming days.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Medical Imaging has seen the biggest healthcare advancements in artificial intelligence and lung health has been at the forefront of these improvements. Lung health has been a key sector for our product portfolio. We’ve built AI algorithms like <em>qXR</em>, which provides automated interpretation of chest X-rays. We augmented its capabilities with <em>qTrack</em> – our AI powered disease management platform, which solves for active case finding &amp; tracking patients in care pathways. These applications have empowered healthcare practitioners at all stages of the patient journey through TB, Covid-19 &amp; lung cancer screenings.</p>

<p>We’re adding a new member to our lung health portfolio: <em>qCT-Lung</em>. Its AI-powered algorithms can interpret chest CTs for findings like lung nodules &amp; emphysema, and analyze their malignancy. It empowers clinicians to detect lung cancer in both screening programs as well as opportunistic screening settings.</p>

<p><em>qXR</em>’s &amp; <em>qCT-Lung</em>’s abilities to detect lung cancer in chest x-rays &amp; CTs complement <em>qTrack</em>’s disease management &amp; patient tracking capability. Together, they round up our lung health portfolio to make it a comprehensive, powerful &amp; unique offering.</p>

<h1 id="lung-cancer---the-most-fatal-cancer">Lung Cancer - The most fatal cancer</h1>

<p>Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men &amp; women.  2.2 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide in 2020 [<a href="#1">1</a>]. With 1.74 million deaths in 2020, lung cancer is also the leading cause of cancer related deaths (18.4%) resulting inmore deaths than the second (colorectal - 9.2%) and third (stomach 8.2%) deadliest cancers combined.</p>

<p>Future projections don’t look good either. Lung cancer incidents are projected to rise by 38%  and the mortality is projected to rise by 39%  by 2030[<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>

<p>There are two main types of lung cancer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): NSCLC comprises of 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. Their major subtypes are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. They are grouped together because of shared similarity in treatment &amp; prognoses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): SCLC tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. 10-15% of all lung cancers are SCLC</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also cancers that start in other organs (like breast) and spread to lung, but they don’t come under the vicinity of lung cancer.</p>

<h1 id="early-detection--outcomes">Early detection &amp; outcomes</h1>
<h3 id="survival-rates">Survival rates</h3>
<p>The 5-year survival is a measure of what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. The 5-year survival rates for both NSCLC &amp; SCLC look as follows[<a href="#4">4</a>]:</p>

<p>The data shows that lung cancer mortality can be reduced significantly if detected &amp; treated early.</p>

<h3 id="early-detection">Early detection</h3>

<p>Data from England shows that the chances of surviving for at least a year decreases from 90% to 20% for the earliest to most advanced stage of lung cancer respectively [5]. WHO elaborates on two components for early detection [6]</p>

<h4 id="early-diagnosis">Early diagnosis</h4>

<p>Early identification of cancer results in better response to treatment, greater chances of survival, lesser morbidity &amp; less expensive treatment. It comprises of 3 components:
•	Being aware of early symptoms of lung cancer like persistent cough, coughing up blood, pain in breathing, continuous breathlessness, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, etc. [7]
•	access to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services
•	timely referral to treatment services.</p>

<h4 id="screening">Screening</h4>

<p>Screening is aimed at identifying individuals with findings suggestive of lung cancer before they have developed symptoms. Further tests are conducted to establish if the diagnosis should be followed or referral for treatments should be made. They’re effective because symptoms of lung cancer do not appear until the disease is already at an advanced stage.</p>
